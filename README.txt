ABOUT
GLBlender1 is the first part of an OpenGL ES & Blender tutorial series, teaching developers how to make an awesome 3D model viewer for iOS that can display models that you create in Blender.
In part 1 You’ll start by learning about one of the simplest formats that Blender can export models to – the OBJ file format. Then you will create a general command line tool to parse this file format and generate suitable arrays in C source code for OpenGL ES. You’ll use a cube as an example shape
The full tutorial is available at:
